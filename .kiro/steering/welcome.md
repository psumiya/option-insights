# Welcome to Your Kiro Workspace

This workspace is configured to help you build features systematically using Kiro's spec-driven development approach.

## Getting Started

You can customize the files in `.kiro/steering/` to add project-specific guidelines, coding standards, or any context that should be available to Kiro across all interactions.

## Useful Tips

- Use `#File` or `#Folder` in chat to reference specific files or folders
- Use `#Codebase` to search across your entire project (once indexed)
- Use `#Problems` to share current errors or warnings
- Use `#Terminal` to share terminal output
- Use `#Git Diff` to show current changes

Happy coding!
